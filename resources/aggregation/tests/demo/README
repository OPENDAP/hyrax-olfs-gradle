This directory contains files that can be used to demonstrate the
'Aggregation handler' developed for the EDSC. While the code is named
a handler, it is actually implemented as a servlet that makes calls to
the BES, bypassing the OLFS. The software can be used by any client
that can form the correct POST-type queries.

How to run these files using curl:

curl -X POST -d @d1_netcdf3_variable_subset.txt http://<host>/opendap/aggregation > d1.zip

host: 52.1.74.222, localhost:8080, etc.

These *.txt files are the text to send, using POST, to the aggregation
servlet. The ones in this directory using long names while the ones in
the 'short_names' directory use names that do not include the
enclosing structure's names - the two name schemes correspond to two
different HDF4 handler configurations (both use CF set to 'yes'). When
the hdf4 handler is built with the hdfeos2 library, the variable names
will not include the enclosing structures when CF is true. When the
handler build does not include the hdfeos2 library the long name
format is used.
